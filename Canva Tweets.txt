El peor servicio de atenciÃ³n al cliente sin duda, @canva. Llevo semanas para que me solucionen un problema y tardan dÃ­as en contestar como robots, y sin entender lo que ocurre. Como ya han cobrado el aÃ±o por adelantado... terrible. Buscad otras opciones porque es terrible.
@ricamposg @canva La mejor opciÃ³n, un estudio de diseÃ±o o un diseÃ±ador de confianzaâ€¦

@canva Worst customer service without a doubt, @canva. Weeks to get a response and in the end, comments like robots. Of course, since I already paid for the year in advance..... look for another option, very bad experience. Imagine how I have to be to waste my time posting comments.

"@thatmarkgilroy @Gary_Cookson @TMSDI Don't reinvent the wheel style-wise, focus on your content. 
If you really want good looking slides use @canva not PowerPoint. 

Also careful of bright solid colour backgrounds if you have your slides full screen you will shade yourself in that colour. 
In this case a Pink Gary."

@Ryan7Read @AmandaFoxSTEM @canva @tishrich These bookmarks are adorable

@Adam_learning @Gary_Cookson @TMSDI @canva Another honourable mention for @HaikuDeck too - albeit I'm still waiting for the day they allow creation of slides in full widescreen format.
@LeeLaunches @louispereira @canva @bubble I see people signing up to the @bubble job newsletter. It's like email based Uber for Bubble gigs. And yeah btw, I'd focus on gigs rather than jobs but totally up to you. âœŒï¸

@harshalachavan7 @canva @MelanieCanva Yeah. Customer retention. If we can download it into MS PPT we wont be coming back to Canva again for edits. The same reason we dont have MS Word for docs in Canva
@elizabutlermd @carrd @Namecheap @Ghost @GetMidnightBlog @canva @FloDesk @zapier @gumroad @hypefury Great to hear something about @carrd . Sounds perfect for me. My website from Squarespace ist way to massive (and expensive).

@BeckyEdu @KyleNiemis @canva @quizizz At the risk of stirring, that's a tough call. I feel that there are a lot of alternatives to Canva and I find Pages, Keynote, iMovie &amp; PowerPoint to be superior offline. (On Windows even MS Publisher has its uses.) I also want something with mail-merge built-in.
For all presentation types, collages and formats for a great online presence I recommend following @canva. They have so many resources for students and educators alike and it can either get free or paid for!

@ZedTrafficker @OneMinuteBriefs @canva Hi ZT Iâ€™m just going over ur back catalogue to get insight into your genius. I think I found it here. Steve jobs.

Q2-Group work in a Google slides or doc, @CanvasLMS discussion boards, or even utilizing @canva to creatively collaborate. Ss just need the chance to enhance each otherâ€™s work or respond and positively critique. #1stTeachChat



A1: There are just SO many excellent Paths that a student could choose to display mastery through a choice board: @Flipgrid, @canva, @ChatterPixIt, or google slide/form just to name a few...Ask your MTS to help you get started with student choice! #1stTeachChat
A3: Daily evidence is crucial in monitoring/adjusting your lessons to meet Ss needs. If Ss have mastered a skill in 2 days vs. 4 days then Ts can then go deeper into the TEK and extend learning. They can go deeper with tools such as @BookCreatorApp or @canva. #1stTeachChat

@JunieBJune4 @mikebotti @canva Love seeing the math application with this fun digital tool!
@NicoleZani3 @canva @StMartinOCSB @iamBigHeadBob I love Canva

@Mr_R_Vela46 @canva I love the idea of using Canva for exit tickets!
@Leblanc_Melisa Paths are my favorite part of blended learning! This allows student choice which helps with active engagement. If a student doesnâ€™t like one path or it doesnâ€™t work for them, they can always choose something else! @Flipgrid @canva @TylerISDlearn #1stTeachChat
@Mr_R_Vela46 @canva I like this idea!! https://t.co/vsR4ZfqCQq

Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m ditching my Adobe sub for @canva PRO. The only downside is no uni student discount so itâ€™s costing me a bit more, but everything else is up Up UP! :)

"If someone says, 'I don't like this tool / app / digital platform' it means THEY don't like it for specific reasons.

BRUH. @canva has a feature where when you add text, and choose a color for it, it offers options to match the text color to colors in an image you've already used on the design. I've been colorblind my whole life and stuff like this just makes me so grateful.

@JenWomble @canva @tishrich @MrNunesteach @fetc @DA_magazine @DA_Leadership A4 - Our district has recently gotten students accounts in my school.

@Badgersssss @canva Same...I just do my best to avoid slides of all types, especially when text and images on a webpage will do
@JenWomble @canva @tishrich @MrNunesteach @fetc @DA_magazine @DA_Leadership A5 - As my new friend @mrshillteaches posted recently, we want to focus on the learning first and bring in the tech second. When adding @canva  in to help kids "show what they know", we open the door to tremendous possibilities in our classes. #FETCchat

@canva Will do! Thank you! ðŸ¤—

@JenWomble @canva @MrNunesteach @tishrich @fetc @DA_magazine @DA_Leadership A6 - We know colors, fonts, and elements add to a creation, but they also have the possibility to distract from the purpose of that creation. When creating, the color palettes and Magic Recommendations can help teachers pick things that will enhance, not distract. #FETCchat

@tishrich @canva I keep this tweet bookmarked and in my @canva collection on @wakelet. Love it so much!
@CleaMahoney @canva Canva has such cute content! But I have other projects and easier ways to do this. Would love more accessibility options
"@canva I wouldn't really change the layout of the design, but I would change the color scheme bit. 
For A: I'd still go for a bright green, but not so light that it may hurt people with sensitive eyes. Maybe a little darker.
For B: I'd change the text to a lighter color. Probably white."
@JenWomble @canva @MrNunesteach @tishrich @fetc @DA_magazine @DA_Leadership A7 - There are so many features in @canva that there will always be someone (student or teacher) asking "How did you do that?".

@JenWomble @canva AND right now, my students are creating â€œYouTubeâ€ content right inside of Canva as well! Thumbnails, channel art, logos, audio, and then hosting to the world (our class) via @Flipgrid. Such a great way to teach a skill like video creation in a safer environment. #FETCchat
@JenWomble @canva @MrNunesteach @tishrich @fetc @DA_magazine @DA_Leadership A2 - There are so many "magical" features in @canva . It's so easy to let students create whatever comes to mind.

@canva How is this going? I just checked and the majority of images for abortion on @canva are still really grim and biased. Some examples below, that make me think there might be an agenda here as some are so violently anti-abortion?! https://t.co/iShJGNgFIU
"@SyberMath @YouTube @Apple @Desmos @NotabilityApp @googledocs @canva I assume that x,y,z is not equal to zero, then the expression is equal to:

(x+y+z)(xy+yz+zx)/xyz - 3 (by factoring x+y+z)

Itâ€™s clear that the expression value is -3"

@canva "A" for sure, but it's also important 2 use less frilly fonts. I did an interesting test, where I got 1 of those accessibility apps to read stuff on packaging. It really struggled with fancy fonts, so keeping it simple is important for the visually impaired, or dyslexic people.

@tishrich @browniesedbites @canva Welcome
@canva why are SVG downloads missing letters in the text with or without transparent backgrounds? All other formats are fine. I emailed you all 2 days ago and still havenâ€™t received an answer

@canva Love the new table feature, but can you provide a way to type in the rows and columns without having to add a 4x3 table and then repeatedly right click and add/remove rows and columns? Or drag to specify size like Docs? If it already exists it's not obvious currently.

@Apple @Microsoft must investigate this @canva website/app's practices of slowing down the devices of users. Just they say they don't do anything is not the answer. Kick it out from the app store and block their website from Edge and Safari to teach them lessons

@SebaMueller @canva Wenn es nur ein Blatt ist, dann kleben die laminierten BlÃ¤tter dran fest und alles ist gut. Du darfst nur nicht mehr als ein Blatt zwischen den Folien haben.
@gretworrell @canva @canva, please, how do I get to see this on my end, I have over a hundred designs already. How do I see it?

"@canva Although B is simple, A is a better design and it appeals to people the most.

Remember People only have short attention span, so you must be able to catch their attention with your design in few seconds."
@dieleselehrerin @canva Ich oute mich mal - laminiere nie.  Darum auch die Frage: was passiert, wenn man laminierte BlÃ¤tter schneidet? War das dann mit der Laminierung?

@canva Hey guys, I think you seriously need to work on the Resume templates. These are graphic, text box and design oriented. These are generally not captured well by Employer application tracking systems. nclude word format option for downloading.Otherwise canva pro is of no use
